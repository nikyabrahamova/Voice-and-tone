# Voice-and-tone
 
## Voice
I'm like an open book- if someone asks me something I don't have a problem, anything to say to anyone. If no one asks and expects me to say it myself, she's usually wrong. I am an extrovert rather, but I also have my days when I am an introvert and I don't want to talk to anyone. As soon as I have to talk about something in front of people that I know, can and do in my native language, it doesn't bother me. If, but I speak in a different language I have a certain block in me where I'm stressed and it's like I've forgotten the whole language. The only place I didn't have a problem with that was when I was on stage with a MICROPHONE, and it was probably a feeling in my head, like I was hiding behind it and not working out who the front runner was, even though it took a thousand people.

## Tone
I'm pretty good at pretending, and even after my voice, you can't tell how I'm feeling. I have a lot of friends telling me I can use my voice a lot the way I need to. Sometimes he's cute (especially when I'm happy about something). Sometimes an apartment can be so deep (when I try to annoy someone and pretend to be the other person). But on the whole, I have a friendly voice so no one will mind how I speak.

## Style
I'm the same in any situation. I don't want anyone to think I'm different from someone else, so I try to have the same conversation with everyone. Obviously, when I work with kids, I'm more, how to say it- CUTE. When I'm with friends I'm myself and when I talk to customers I'm more serious, but I try to lead it in a friendly way so it's more enjoyable for both parties.
